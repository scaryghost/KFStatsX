## Release Information
https://github.com/scaryghost/KFStatsX/releases/tag/3.2

## About
Provides advanced statistics about a player's performance and tracks game information for each match.  This started out 
as enhancements to Game Stats Tab but I did not like how static everything was.  Eventually, I decided to rebuild the 
mutator from ground up and new features have made the mutator more resemble HLStatsX.

As of version 3.1.1, the default KFStatsX player controller is compatible with objective mode.

## Version
3.2

## Check Sum
The check sum for the package is generated with the following command from the system folder:

    ucc.exe Editor.CheckSumPackage KFStatsX.u

If the output does not match any of the hashes in this README, you do not have an official version from me.

## Usage
An extra tab will be present in the ESC menu titled "KFStatsX".  The tab's panel will provide a statistical summary for 
all players on the server.  

## Special Thanks
    Marco - ServerPerks was instrumental in helping me understand how to setup 
            a vertical list and utilize the UDPLink class to broadcast to a remote server.
